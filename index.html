									<h1>Let me introduce<br />
									myself</h1>
									<p>  Welcome! I’m Raúl Reyna, an engineer and consultant passionate about automation, digital transformation, and AI. Over the years, I’ve helped businesses and teams simplify complex processes, save time, and focus on what truly matters. Here’s a glimpse into my journey and the value I bring.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
  									Over the past 5 years, I’ve taken on key roles in multidisciplinary projects across construction, telecommunications, and IT — coordinating with vendors, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams to ensure objectives are met and processes run smoothly. In addition, I hold a Master of Science in Integrated Manufacturing Systems from the Silesian University of Technology in Poland, where I lived for two years and strengthened both my technical expertise and intercultural experience. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This combination of professional achievements and international experience has shaped a global mindset, enabling me to analyze problems from diverse perspectives, adapt quickly to changing environments, and collaborate effectively across cultures. Living in Poland and working with multicultural teams strengthened my ability to approach challenges with creativity, openness, and resilience. I am fluent in Spanish and English, hold an A2 level in German, and have conversational knowledge of Russian and Polish — language skills that further enhance communication, teamwork, and adaptability in international settings.
								</p>
								<p>
									My expertise includes gathering and analyzing requirements, identifying opportunities for process improvement, managing change effectively, and contributing to the successful delivery of high-impact initiatives. Experienced in analyzing internal processes and enhancing them through automation, I leverage available platforms to their fullest potential. I lead teams under pressure, foster collaboration, and maintain clear communication with clients — whether delivering good news or addressing challenges. Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in risk identification, mitigation, and escalation management, handling critical issues under tight deadlines and ensuring service continuity in high-impact environments.
								</p>
								<p>
									Highly analytical in evaluating situations, spotting business opportunities, and defining requirements, I stay up to date with the latest advancements in AI, IT, automation, security, and risk analysis. I am also proficient in enterprise tools such as Confluence, Jira, Microsoft 365, and Google Workspace, ensuring smooth integration with diverse corporate environments. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Beyond my professional career, I founded HYDRAI Connections, a consultancy dedicated to helping businesses and entrepreneurs take the leap into digitalization. We focus on building smart chatbots and automation workflows that streamline processes, reduce errors, and save valuable time — enabling even those who have not yet transitioned to operate with the efficiency and innovation that today’s world demands. To achieve this, I leverage powerful platforms such as ManyChat, Make.com, Power Automate, and GPT models, always applying technology strategically where it delivers clear, measurable value. My mission is to keep clients at the forefront of technological change with practical, results-driven solutions that fuel sustainable growth.
								</p>
								<p>
								Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about living an active and meaningful life. Sports — particularly soccer and martial arts — are not only hobbies but disciplines that help me manage stress, build resilience, and maintain both physical and mental strength. I’ve had the opportunity to visit more than 15 countries, experiences that have broadened my cultural awareness and enriched the way I connect with people and ideas. Music in different languages, continuous learning, and exploring new cultures, cuisines, and perspectives fuel my creativity and curiosity. For me, constant growth and evolution are essential — they keep me sharp, motivated, and ready to face the challenges of an ever-changing world.
